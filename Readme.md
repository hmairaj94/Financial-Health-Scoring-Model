# Financial Health Scoring Model

## Overview

This project is a financial health scoring system that takes input from a user (such as income, savings, monthly expenses, etc.) and calculates a financial health score. The system provides recommendations based on the score and displays visualizations of spending distribution.

The project consists of two main components:
- **Flask API**: Handles the backend logic, including calculating the financial score.
- **Streamlit App**: Provides the front-end interface where the user can input their data and receive feedback.
